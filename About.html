<h2>Our project</h2>
<p>
    This is a project for our Web-Reporting course. The main goal was to create web pages using API, we chose pokeapi.co a Pokémon themed API.
    We aim to continue this project for another course, but the technology might change a little bit.
    
    This tool is a trainer's guide to help create the best pokemons with the best caracteristics.

<h2>The Pokémon API</h2>
<p>
    The API updated quickly after we started this project, with more mature and complete content concerning all pokemons.
    Its update added more mature and complete content concerning all pokemons.
</p>
<h2>Our work</h2>
<p>
    We had to understand the complex structure of the API first, because of all its content it was, at first, hard to understand how it worked.
    We got along its mechanics and now know some of its structure.
    We worked on all the algorithm and restructured all the information available through the API.
